# fatEstimation

The **`fatEstimation`** R package implements the *Forecasted Average Treatment Effects (FAT)* methodology from [Botosaru, Giacomini, and Weidner (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02121), which allows for causal inference **without requiring a traditional control group**.

This method is especially useful in cases of:

- Universal or staggered treatment adoption,
- Endogenous policy timing,
- No clear or valid comparison units.

Instead of comparing treated units to a control group, the package forecasts **unit-specific counterfactual outcomes** using pre-treatment trends, and estimates the treatment effect as the deviation from these forecasts.

For a full overview, see the [**vignette**](./vignettes/fatEstimator_vignette.html) or run `vignette("fatEstimator_vignette", package = "fatEstimation")`.

## Motivation

Standard treatment effect estimators (e.g. Difference-in-Differences) depend on finding valid comparison units. This can be difficult when:

- All units are eventually treated,
- Treatment timing is endogenous,
- Comparison groups differ structurally from treated units.

The **FAT estimator** bypasses this by:
- Fitting a unit-specific model to the *pre-treatment outcome history*,
- Forecasting the counterfactual outcome path,
- Estimating treatment effects as the difference between observed and forecasted outcomes.

It is formally grounded in recent econometric theory and allows for flexible polynomial trends, covariates, and placebo testing.

## Installation

Install the development version from GitHub:

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("laurazell/fatEstimation")

# From local source (if you're developing it)
devtools::load_all()
```

## Features

- Forecasted counterfactuals via unit-level polynomial trend regression
- Supports multiple forecast horizons and degrees
- Allows for model extensions with:
  - Homogeneous and heterogeneous covariates
  - Instrumental variables (IV) for endogeneity
  - Difference-in-FAT (DFAT) when a noisy control group is available
- Fast and flexible:
  - Computes analytic, clustered, or bootstrap standard errors
  - Diagnostics, placebo checks, and plotting functions built-in

## Example using the cannabis_overdose dataset
The package includes a cleaned dataset cannabis_overdose, derived from the study by Shover et al. It tracks opioid overdose mortality rates across U.S. states and the adoption of medical cannabis laws. (I assume we might not have the right to use this, when making the package public, but for now, it's the data set for which we have FAT results for comparison.)

```r
library(fatEstimation)

data(cannabis_overdose)

# Run FAT estimation for deg = 0:2, hh = 1:3
results <- estimate_fat(
  data = cannabis_overdose,
  unit_var = "state",
  time_var = "Year",
  outcome_var = "ln_age_mort_rate",
  treat_time_var = "adopt_year",
  units_to_include = unique(cannabis_overdose$state),
  degrees = 0:2,
  horizons = 1:3,
  se_method = "analytic"
)

print(results)

# Plot results
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(results, aes(x = hh, y = FAT, color = as.factor(deg))) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = FAT - 1.96 * sdFAT, ymax = FAT + 1.96 * sdFAT)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Forecasted Average Treatment Effects",
       x = "Horizon (Years after adoption)",
       color = "Polynomial Degree")
       
# Diagnostic plot
plot_fat_diagnostics(results)

```
